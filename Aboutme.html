<p style="background-color:white;padding:20px 40px;"><b><i>Inventive, thoughtful, original & consistent.</b></i><br><br>
<i>Education:</i> Bachelor's degree at LCC International University, <br> Contemporary Communication.<br><br>
<i>Past working experiences:</i> One year of Client Support Management. <br><br>
I've always believed that <b>being passionate about everything you do</b> is the <b>key secret</b> of reaching absolute <i>success</i>. 
This belief made me recognize that exactly communication makes me move better than anything else. <br><br>
As the times pass, communication is growing in a fast pace, and the way we understand <b>"effective" communication</b> constantly changes.<br> 
I am someone who is consistently growing themselves and who takes the time to <i>continue learning</i> even though it's not a direct requirement of the job. <br>
I’m comfortable adjusting to any situation and don’t get flustered easily when faced with unexpected challenges.<br><br>
I’m <b>organized</b>-it helps a lot, when dealing with dozens of collected surveys <i>(haha!)</i> . <br><br> 
I really enjoy working with a wide variety of people to achieve a common goal efficiently and realistically. While working as a Customer Support Manager, 
I learnt, that <b>teamwork</b> is unbelievably valuable, and that's a part of what I might teach Your company's workers, if You're facing internal communication issues.
<br><br>
I seek to help companies become successful by having <b><i>strong leadership</b></i> and <b><i>vision</b></i>, followed by recognition and <b><i>rewarding</b></i> of performers.
<br><br>
 I am someone who has a consultative selling style and who is concerned with the clients' needs.
 <b>I can help You</b> to uncover the what the client <i>truly</i> wants and show You how to meet those requirements.
<br><br>

<i><b>Let me help You!</i></b>
