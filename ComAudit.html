<p style="background-color:white;padding:20px 40px;"><strong>Trust</strong> between your organization and its key stakeholders is a key component to your business that you must nurture and grow. You rely on the quality of your communications efforts to build that trust. <i> Are you reaching the right audiences with the right messages? Is your message consistent? Do you address your employees’ concerns?</i><br>
<br>
<br>

To determine whether your communications tools are working well, you need a communications audit: a snapshot of your organization’s communications strategies, activities and programs.
<br><br>
A communications audit determines both how effective your current communications tools are, including their strengths and weaknesses, and provides recommendations and improvements necessary for your communications plan to work even better.
<br>
<br>
<b>What are the benefits of executing a communications audit?</b><br><br>

It improves communication <b>within your organization</b> and helps to build trust and commitment among employees. It also helps to determine the best ways to communicate with the <b>external public</b> in order to reach your organization’s goals.
<br>
<br>
<b>How do I personally perform a communications audit?</b><br><br>

I analyze your organization’s communications tools, such as your <i>website, annual report, newsletter, press releases, social media strategy and blog, etc.</i>

Then I gather and analyze the feedback from your key stakeholders through <i>focus groups, surveys, interviews, media coverage and one-on-one conversations with management and staff.</i>
<br><br>
Based on the feedback received, I will consult you and recommend specific changes to your current communications strategies as well as additional steps and adjustments you can make to your communications plan.
<br><br>
<b>You must adjust your organization’s communications plan to the always-changing needs of your stakeholders in order to achieve your objectives. A communications audit is how you will improve your communications practices in the future.<b>
